## assert_eq!

This test has a problem with it -- make the test compile!
Make the test pass!
Make the test fail!

<div class="hint">
  Like the previous exercise, you don't need to write any code to get this test to compile and run.
  `assert_eq!` is a macro that takes two arguments and compares them.
  Try giving it two values that are equal!
  Try giving it two arguments that are different!
  Try giving it two values that are of different types!
  Try switching which argument comes first and which comes second!
