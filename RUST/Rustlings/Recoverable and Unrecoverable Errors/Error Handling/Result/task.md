## Result

Make this test pass!

<div class="hint">
  `PositiveNonzeroInteger::new` is always creating a new instance and returning an `Ok` result.
  It should be doing some checking, returning an `Err` result if those checks fail, and only returning an `Ok` result if those checks determine that everything is... okay :)
</div>
