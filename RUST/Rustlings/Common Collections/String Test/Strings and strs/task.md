## Strrings and &strs

This is a test for the following sections:
* Strings

Ok, here are a bunch of values -- some are `Strings`, some are `&strs`.
Your task is to call one of these two functions on each value depending on what you think each value is.
That is, add either `string_slice` or `string` before the parentheses on each line.
If you're right, it will compile!
