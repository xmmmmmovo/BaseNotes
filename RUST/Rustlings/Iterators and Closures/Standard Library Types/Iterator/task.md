## Iterator

This is a bigger exercise than most of the others!
You can do it!

Here is your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Complete the divide function to get the first four tests to pass
2. Uncomment the last two tests and get them to pass by filling in values for `x` using `division_results`.

Scroll down for a minor hint for part 2, and scroll down further for a major hint.
Have fun :-)

<div class="hint">
  In each of the two cases in the match in main, you can create x with either a 'turbofish' or by hinting the type of x to the compiler.
  You may try both.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Have a look at the Iter trait and at the explanation of its collect function.
  Especially the part about Result is interesting.
