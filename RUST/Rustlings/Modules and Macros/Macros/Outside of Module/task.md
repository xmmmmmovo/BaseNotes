## Outside of Module

Make me compile, without taking the macro out of the module!

<div class="hint">
  In order to use a macro outside of its module, you need to do something special to the module to lift the macro out into its parent.

  The same trick also works on "extern crate" statements for crates that have exported macros, if you've seen any of those around.
