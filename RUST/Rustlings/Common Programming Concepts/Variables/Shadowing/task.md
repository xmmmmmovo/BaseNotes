### Shadowing

In Rust, you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is _shadowed_ by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what appears when the variable is used. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it shadows `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of `x` is then `6`. The third `let` statement also shadows `x`, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a final value of `12`. When we run this program, it will output the following:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12
```


Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:


let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();

This construct is allowed because the first `spaces` variable is a string type and the second `spaces` variable, which is a brand-new variable that happens to have the same name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name. However, if we try to use mut for this, as shown here, we’ll get a compile-time error:

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

The error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:

```text
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:3:14
  |
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &str, found usize
  |
  = note: expected type `&str`
             found type `usize`
```

_You can refer to the following chapter in the Rust Programming Language Book: [Shadowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing)_

Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let's apply our knowledge in practice.
