## Tuples

Destructure the `cat` tuple so that the println will work.

<div class="hint">
  Take a look at the Data Types -> The Tuple Type section of the book:
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type

  Particularly the part about destructuring (second to last example in the section).

  You'll need to make a pattern to bind `name` and `age` to the appropriate parts of the tuple. You can do it!!
