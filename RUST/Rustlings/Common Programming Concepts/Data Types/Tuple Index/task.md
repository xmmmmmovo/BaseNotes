## Tuple Index

Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`.

You can put this right into the `println!`.

<div class="hint">
  While you could use a destructuring `let` for the tuple here, try indexing into it instead, as explained in the last example of the <a href ="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">Data Types - The Tuple Type section of the book</a>.

  Now you have another tool in your toolbox!
