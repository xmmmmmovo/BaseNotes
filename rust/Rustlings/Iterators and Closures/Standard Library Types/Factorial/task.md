## Factorial

Complete this function to return factorial of num.

Do not use:
- `return`

For extra fun don't use:
- imperative style loops (`for`, `while`)
- additional variables

For the most fun don't use:
- recursion

<div class="hint">
  In an imperative language you might write a for loop to iterate through multiply the values into a mutable variable.
  Or you might write code more functionally with recursion and a match clause.
  But you can also use ranges and iterators to solve this in rust.
