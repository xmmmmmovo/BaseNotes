## Arrays

Create an array with at least 100 elements.

<div class="hint">
  There's a shorthand to initialize Arrays with a certain size that does not require you to type in 100 items (but you certainly can if you want!).

  For example, you can do:
  ```rust
  let array = ["Are we there yet?"; 10];
  ```
</div>

Bonus: what are some other things you could have that would return true for `a.len()` <code>&gt;</code>`= 100`?
