## Return Type

This store is having a sale where if the price is an even number, you get 10 (money unit) off, but if it's an odd number, it's 3 (money unit) less.

<div class="hint">
  The error message points to line 6 and says it expects a type after the `->`.
  This is where the function's return type should be -- take a look at the `is_even` function for an example!
</div>
